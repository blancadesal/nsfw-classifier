# nsfw-classifier

This repository contains a series of notebooks that serve as the basis for my proposed implementation of a NSFW Classifier for Wikimedia Commons:

1. NSFW-resnet50-baseline.ipynb
2. NSFW-resnet50-baseline-with-cleaned-dataset.ipynb
3. NSFW-resnet50-baseline-with-augmentation.ipynb
4. NSFW-resnet50-baseline-with-cleaned-dataset-and-augmentation.ipynb
5. NSFW_Squeezenet_model.ipynb

Of these, the first two contain a detailed discussion of my overall approach, methodology and results. The last three are code-only.
